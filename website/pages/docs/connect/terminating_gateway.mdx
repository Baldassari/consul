# Terminating Gateways

-> **1.8.0+:**  This feature is available in Consul versions 1.8.0 and newer.

Terminating gateways enable connections from services in the Consul service mesh to
services outside the mesh. These gateways effectively act as Connect proxies that can
represent more than one service. They terminate Connect mTLS connections, enforce intentions,
and forward requests to the appropriate destination.

For data that must be encrypted in transit to the final destination, terminating gateways
support TLS origination. By specifying a [CA file](/docs/agent/config-entries/terminating-gateway#cafile),
[client certificate](/docs/agent/config-entries/terminating-gateway#certfile), and
[private key](/docs/agent/config-entries/terminating-gateway#keyfile),
connections from the gateway to a linked service can be encrypted using one-way or mutual TLS.
If none of these are provided, Consul will only encrypt connections to the gateway and not
from the gateway to the destination service. 

-> **Note:** If certificates and keys are configured the gateway will upgrade HTTP connections to TLS. 
Client applications can issue plain HTTP requests even when connecting to servers that require HTTPS.

## Prerequisites

Each terminating gateway needs two things:

1. A local Consul agent to manage its configuration.
2. General network connectivity to services within its local Consul datacenter.

Terminating gateways also require that your Consul datacenters are configured correctly:

- You'll need to use Consul version 1.8.0.
- Consul [Connect](/docs/agent/options#connect) must be enabled in the datacenter.
- [gRPC](/docs/agent/options#grpc_port) must be enabled.
- [Centralized configuration](/docs/agent/options#enable_central_service_config) must be enabled.

Currently, Envoy is the only proxy with terminating gateway capabilities in Consul.

- Terminating gateway proxies receive their configuration through Consul, which
  automatically generates it based on the gateway's registration. Currently Consul
  can only translate terminating gateway registration information into Envoy
  configuration, therefore the proxies acting as terminating gateways must be Envoy.

Sidecar proxies that send upstream traffic through a gateway aren't
affected when you deploy terminating gateways. If you are using non-Envoy proxies as
Connect sidecars they will continue to work for traffic directed at services linked to
a terminating gateway as long as they discover upstreams with the
[/health/connect](/api/health#list-nodes-for-connect-capable-service) endpoint.

## Running and Using a Terminating Gateway

The steps that need to occur for a terminating gateway to proxy traffic from services in the Consul mesh are as follows:

1. Run an envoy proxy using the [envoy subcommand](/docs/commands/connect/envoy#terminating-gateways), specifying the `terminating` gateway type.
2. Create a `terminating-gateway` [configuration entry](/docs/agent/config-entries/terminating-gateway) that defines 
a set of services that the gateway will proxy traffic to. The config entry can be applied via the 
[CLI](/docs/commands/config/write) or [API](/api/config#apply-configuration).
3. Ensure that [intentions](/docs/commands/intention#consul-intention) are set up between the source services in the mesh 
and the gateway's linked services. The intentions must reference the destination service's name and not the gateway itself.

## Terminating Gateway Configuration

Terminating gateways are defined very similarly to other typical services, with two exceptions.
The first is that the [kind](/api/agent/service#kind) must be "terminating-gateway". The other
is that a terminating gateway service definition may contain a `Proxy.Config` entry just like a
Connect proxy service to define opaque configuration parameters useful for the actual proxy software.
For Envoy there are some supported [gateway options](/docs/connect/proxies/envoy#gateway-options) as well as
[escape-hatch overrides](/docs/connect/proxies/envoy#escape-hatch-overrides).

-> **Note:** If ACLs are enabled, the gateways must be registered with a token granting `service:write`
for the gateway's service name **and** all linked services. These permissions will authorize the gateway
to terminate mTLS connections on behalf of the linked services.

Linking services to a terminating gateway is done with a `terminating-gateway`
[configuration entry](/docs/agent/config-entries/terminating-gateway). This config entry can be applied via the 
[CLI](/docs/commands/config/write) or [API](/api/config#apply-configuration).

The services that the gateway will proxy for must be registered with Consul for the gateway to discover their addresses.
These services can be registered with a local Consul agent, or if there is no agent present,
the services can be registered [directly in the catalog](/api/catalog#register-entity).

Since Consul's services must be associated with a node, direct registrations to the catalog must define a node as well.
This node's [name](/api/catalog.html#node) **must not** overlap with a node managed by a Consul agent.
Otherwise the service registration will be deleted by that agent during the periodic
[anti-entropy sync](/docs/internals/anti-entropy). Lastly, all agent-less services with the same address can
be registered under the same node name and address.
